## Doing data science

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Programming:**

  - R
  - RStudio
  - tidyverse
  - R Markdown

:::

::: {.column width = "50%"}

**Version control and collaboration:**

  - Git
  - GitHub
  
:::

## Learning goals

By the end of the course, you will be able to...

::: incremental

- gain insight from data

- gain insight from data, **reproducibly**

- gain insight from data, reproducibly, **using modern programming tools and techniques**

- gain insight from data, reproducibly **and collaboratively**, using modern programming tools and techniques

- gain insight from data, reproducibly **(with literate programming and version control)** and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques

# Reproducible data analysis


## Reproducibility checklist

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Question:

What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?

:::

## Reproducibility checklist


**Near-term goals:**

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? 

**Long-term goals:**

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?


## Toolkit for reproducibility

- Scriptability  :arrow_right: R

- Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place)  :arrow_right: Quarto Markdown

- Version control  :arrow_right: Git / GitHub


# R and RStudio
 

---

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](img/r-logo.png)

- R: open-source statistical **programming language**
- Environment for statistical computing and graphics
- Easily extensible with *packages*
- The engine that runs code

:::

::: {.column width = "50%"}

![](img/rstudio-logo.png)

- RStudio: interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment)
- Not a requirement but very commonly used 
- The car that houses the engine

:::

:::

---

## R packages

- **Packages**: fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data[^1]

- As of January 2025, there are almost 22,000 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)[^2]

- We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these

[^1]: Wickham and Bryan, [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)

[^2]: [CRAN contributed packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)



## Tour: R and RStudio

## A short list (for now) of R essentials: *functions*

<br>

Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```


## A short list (for now) of R essentials: *packages*

<br>

Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```



## R essentials (continued)

<br>

Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
dataframe$var_name
```

## R essentials (continued)

<br>

Function documentation can be accessed with `?`

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
?mean
```



## tidyverse

::: columns
:::{.column width = "50%"}

![](img/tidyverse.png)

:::

:::{.column width = "50%"}


[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

- The **tidyverse** is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar

# Quarto

## Quarto

::: columns

:::{.column width="70%"}

[https://quarto.org/](https://quarto.org/)

- **Quarto** and the various packages that support it enable R users to write their code and prose in reproducible computational documents
- We will generally refer to quarto documents (with `.qmd` extension), e.g. *"Do this in your quarto document"* and rarely discuss loading the quarto package

:::

:::{.column width = "30%"}

![](img/quarto-logo.png)

:::

:::


## Quarto

- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you render the analysis is ran from the beginning
- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks



## Tour: Quarto

![](img/tour-rmarkdown.png)

## Environments

::: {.callout-note}
The environment of your quarto document is separate from the console!
:::

* Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work 
with quarto! 

* When you render a document, quarto "forgets" what you already have saved in your environment and re-runs your entire document from scratch. Everything you need to run your code needs to be in your quarto doc in order for it to render correctly.


## Environments

::: columns

:::{.column width = "50%"}

First, run the following in the console

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x <- 2
x * 3
```

Looks good?

:::

:::{.column width = "50%"}

Then, add the following in an R chunk in a blank quarto document and try to render it.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x * 3
```

What happens? Why the error?

:::

:::

## Environments

You didn't assign `x <- 2` as an object in your quarto document! 

Rendering reruns everything from scratch, so it couldn't find an object called `x` in the environment.

## How will we use Quarto?

- Every assignment / report / project / etc. is a Quarto document

- You'll always have a template Quarto document to start with

- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester



## What's with all the hexes?

# Git and GitHub


## Git and GitHub

::: columns

::: {.column width = "50%"}

![](img/git-logo.png){height=1in}

- Git is a version control system -- like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word, on steroids
- It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one

:::

::: {.column width = "50%"}


![](img/Github-Symbol.png){height=1in}

- GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better

- We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration (and as our course management system)

# Git and GitHub tips

::: incremental 

- There are a lot of git commands. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

- If you google for git help you might come across methods using the command line/terminal -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.

- There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/). Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.
