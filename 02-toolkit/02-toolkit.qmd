# Data science toolkit overview

## Recall our learning goals

By the end of the course, you will be able to...

::: incremental

- gain insight from data

- gain insight from data, **reproducibly**

- gain insight from data, reproducibly, **using modern programming tools and techniques**

- gain insight from data, reproducibly **and collaboratively**, using modern programming tools and techniques

- gain insight from data, reproducibly **(with literate programming and version control)** and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques

## Reproducibility definition

*The ability to obtain consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis*

- National Academies [Reproducibility and Replicability in Science](Reproducibility and Replicability in Science)

## Benefits of reproducibility

<br>

- Ensures scientific work can be trusted
- Facilitates collaboration and review
- Helps prevent misinformation and duplicate work


## Reproducibility vs. replicability

<br>

Reproducibility is different from replicability, which involves new data collection to confirm findings.


## Reproducibility checklist

A reproducible analysis includes:

- Data 
- Code for cleaning raw data
- Code and packages for analysis
- Careful documentation and explanation of the analysis
- No "by hand" steps. Everything is done via code.

Ideally all this is all tied up in a neat little package and made publicly available. This is a hallmark of "open science."

## R packages

- **Packages**: fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data

- As of January 2026, there are over 23,000 R packages available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)

- We're going to work with a small but important subset of these (the tidyverse!)


## R packages

<br>

Packages are installed with the `install.packages()` function and loaded with the `library()` function:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

<br>

Packages only need to be *installed* once. They need to be *loaded* every time you open a new R session.


## Functions

<br>
**Function:** A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

Functions are often verbs, followed by *arguments* that specify how the function will be applied in parentheses: 
<br>
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

## Example of a function

Note to self: show examples of functions in live code


## tidyverse: an ecosystem of packages

::: columns
:::{.column width = "50%"}

![](img/tidyverse.png)

:::

:::{.column width = "50%"}


[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

- The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed for data science
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar
:::
:::

## R is an object-oriented computing environment

<br>
When you run code in the console, the code is executed but the results aren't saved anywhere.
<br>
```{r echo=TRUE}
5 * 4
```


## R is an object-oriented computing environment

<br>
If you assign the output of your code as an object using `<-`, the object will be added to your *global environment.* They aren't saved permanently to your computer, but they are stored in the memory of your current R session. You can then do calculations with objects and pass them to functions.
```{r echo=TRUE}
x <- 5 * 4

x
```


# Quarto: Literate programming

## Quarto

::: columns

:::{.column width="70%"}

[https://quarto.org/](https://quarto.org/)

- Quarto enables R users to write both their code and prose in reproducible computational documents
- Quarto documents have a .qmd file extension
- They use simple markdown syntax for text
- Code goes in "chunks," narrative goes outside of chunks

## Quarto tour

Note to self: show elements of Quarto docs in live code



## Quarto, objects, and the R environment

::: {.callout-note}
The environment of your Quarto document is separate from your global environment!
:::

* When you render a document, Quarto "forgets" what you already have saved in your environment and re-runs your entire document from scratch. Everything needed to run your code needs to be in your quarto doc in order for it to render.

* Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work 
with quarto! 


## Example: Quarto, objects, and the R environmentnts

::: columns

:::{.column width = "50%"}

First, run the following in the console

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x <- 2
x * 3
```

Looks good?

:::

:::{.column width = "50%"}

Then, add the following in an R chunk in a blank quarto document and try to render it.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x * 3
```

What happens? Why the error?

:::

:::

## Example: Quarto, objects, and the R environmentnts

You didn't assign `x <- 2` as an object in your quarto document! 

Rendering reruns everything from scratch, so it couldn't find an object called `x` in the environment.

## How will we use Quarto?

- Every assignment / report / project / etc. is a Quarto document

- You'll always have a template Quarto document to start with

- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester



# Git and GitHub: Version control and collaboration


## Git and GitHub

::: columns

::: {.column width = "50%"}

![](img/git-logo.png){height=1in}

- **Git:** version control system like “Track Changes” on steroids
- It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one

:::

- **GitHub:** a place to host Git-based projects on the internet

- We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration (and as our course management system)

# Git and GitHub tips

::: incremental 

- There are a lot of git commands. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

- If you Google for git help you might find solutions using the command line/terminal -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.

- A great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/). Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.
